title: "KN95 Mask Price Dataset"

I've started putting together a dataset on [KN95 mask prices](https://maskprice.info) after seeing masks from AliExpress being sold at a tenfold markup on European marketplaces. My goal with this project is to raise awareness about alternative marketplaces and fight price gouging.

The dataset consists of the unit prices of products *advertised* as KN95 masks on various online marketplaces at certain dates. Product URLs are scraped automatically, but price, quantity and availability data is gathered by MTurk workers. The data is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/abiro/mask-price-data) and it's updated at least once a week.
